\chapter{Conclusion}
	
	Parallel computing is big but tough. Interconnect in particular is a bit fun,
	especially for brain simulators.
	
	Current work has a rich selection of networks in use but for brain
	simulation??? In particular multicast seems a little less well trodden.
	
	My work looks at SpiNNaker and I have been working on simulating this and the
	problems relating for wiring etc.
