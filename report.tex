		The human brain is one of the most complex structures known to man and
		allows us to perform remarkable range of computational feats completely
		inaccessible to any machine. Recent efforts to study the brain have led
		researchers to devise novel massively-parallel computer architectures in
		order to cope with the unique demands of brain simulation software. The
		SpiNNaker project is developing one such machine based on over 1,000,000
		custom low-power ARM processors. My research aims to improve the way in
		which these processors connect together to improve the performance of
		simulations and other software on the system.
